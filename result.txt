in 2
my 2
younger 2
and 2
more 2
vulnerable 2
years 2
my 3
father 2
gave 2
me 2
some 2
advice 2
that 2
i 2
ve 2
been 2
turning 2
over 2
in 3
my 4
mind 2
ever 2
since 2
whenever 2
you 2
feel 2
like 2
criticizing 2
anyone 2
he 2
told 2
me 3
just 2
remember 2
that 3
all 2
the 2
people 2
in 4
this 2
world 2
haven 2
t 2
had 2
the 3
advantages 2
that 4
you 3
ve 3
had 3
he 3
didn 2
t 3
say 2
any 2
more 3
but 2
we 2
ve 4
always 2
been 3
unusually 2
communicative 2
in 5
a 2
reserved 2
way 2
and 3
i 3
understood 2
that 5
he 4
meant 2
a 3
great 2
deal 2
more 4
than 2
that 6
in 6
consequence 2
i 4
m 2
inclined 2
to 2
reserve 2
all 3
judgements 2
a 4
habit 2
that 7
has 2
opened 2
up 2
many 2
curious 2
natures 2
to 3
me 4
and 4
also 2
made 2
me 5
the 4
victim 2
of 2
not 2
a 5
few 2
veteran 2
bores 2
the 5
abnormal 2
mind 3
is 2
quick 2
to 4
detect 2
and 5
attach 2
itself 2
to 5
this 3
quality 2
when 2
it 2
appears 2
in 7
a 6
normal 2
person 2
and 6
so 2
it 3
came 2
about 2
that 8
in 8
college 2
i 5
was 2
unjustly 2
accused 2
of 3
being 2
a 7
politician 2
because 2
i 6
was 3
privy 2
to 6
the 6
secret 2
griefs 2
of 4
wild 2
unknown 2
men 2
most 2
of 5
the 7
confidences 2
were 2
unsought 2
frequently 2
i 7
have 2
feigned 2
sleep 2
preoccupation 2
or 2
a 8
hostile 2
levity 2
when 3
i 8
realized 2
by 2
some 3
unmistakable 2
sign 2
that 9
an 2
intimate 2
revelation 2
was 4
quivering 2
on 2
the 8
horizon 2
for 2
the 9
intimate 3
revelations 2
of 6
young 2
men 3
or 3
at 2
least 2
the 10
terms 2
in 9
which 2
they 2
express 2
them 2
are 2
usually 2
plagiaristic 2
and 7
marred 2
by 3
obvious 2
suppressions 2
reserving 2
judgements 3
is 3
a 9
matter 2
of 7
infinite 2
hope 2
i 9
am 2
still 2
a 10
little 2
afraid 2
of 8
missing 2
something 2
if 2
i 10
forget 2
that 10
as 2
my 5
father 3
snobbishly 2
suggested 2
and 8
i 11
snobbishly 3
repeat 2
a 11
sense 2
of 9
the 11
fundamental 2
decencies 2
is 4
parcelled 2
out 2
unequally 2
at 3
birth 2
and 9
after 2
boasting 2
this 4
way 3
of 10
my 6
tolerance 2
i 12
come 2
to 7
the 12
admission 2
that 11
it 4
has 3
a 12
limit 2
conduct 2
may 2
be 2
founded 2
on 3
the 13
hard 2
rock 2
or 4
the 14
wet 2
marshes 2
but 3
after 3
a 13
certain 2
point 2
i 13
don 2
t 4
care 2
what 2
it 5
s 2
founded 3
on 4
when 4
i 14
came 3
back 2
from 2
the 15
east 2
last 2
autumn 2
i 15
felt 2
that 12
i 16
wanted 2
the 16
world 3
to 8
be 3
in 10
uniform 2
and 10
at 4
a 14
sort 2
of 11
moral 2
attention 2
forever 2
i 17
wanted 3
no 2
more 5
riotous 2
excursions 2
with 2
privileged 2
glimpses 2
into 2
the 17
human 2
heart 2
only 2
gatsby 2
the 18
man 2
who 2
gives 2
his 2
name 2
to 9
this 5
book 2
was 5
exempt 2
from 3
my 7
reaction 2
gatsby 3
who 3
represented 2
everything 2
for 3
which 3
i 18
have 3
an 3
unaffected 2
scorn 2
if 3
personality 2
is 5
an 4
unbroken 2
series 2
of 12
successful 2
gestures 2
then 2
there 2
was 6
something 3
gorgeous 2
about 3
him 2
some 4
heightened 2
sensitivity 2
to 10
the 19
promises 2
of 13
life 2
as 3
if 4
he 5
were 3
related 2
to 11
one 2
of 14
those 2
intricate 2
machines 2
that 13
register 2
earthquakes 2
ten 2
thousand 2
miles 2
away 2
this 6
responsiveness 2
had 4
nothing 2
to 12
do 2
with 3
that 14
flabby 2
impressionability 2
which 4
is 6
dignified 2
under 2
the 20
name 3
of 15
the 21
creative 2
temperament 2
it 6
was 7
an 5
extraordinary 2
gift 2
for 4
hope 3
a 15
romantic 2
readiness 2
such 2
as 4
i 19
have 4
never 2
found 2
in 11
any 3
other 2
person 3
and 11
which 5
it 7
is 7
not 3
likely 2
i 20
shall 2
ever 3
find 2
again 2
no 3
gatsby 4
turned 2
out 3
all 4
right 2
at 5
the 22
end 2
it 8
is 8
what 3
preyed 2
on 5
gatsby 5
what 4
foul 2
dust 2
floated 2
in 12
the 23
wake 2
of 16
his 3
dreams 2
that 15
temporarily 2
closed 2
out 4
my 8
interest 2
in 13
the 24
abortive 2
sorrows 2
and 12
short 2
winded 2
elations 2
of 17
men 4
